                    Skills - I am knowledgeable in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I can do a front flip into a pool, and I used to be able to dunk in high school.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interests - I play a lot of video games, mostly Call of Duty, Minecraft, Valorant, and Farming Simulator, I watch way too much anime, and I like my cats even though they're a little rude sometimes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Career Goals - I hope to start out in the industry by learning as much as I can so that I can have all the tools for success and to be a good developer. I would like to be a game developer at some point, but that's currently on the backburner.
